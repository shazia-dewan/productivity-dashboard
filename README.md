# Habit Tracking Dashboard

## Summary
The **Habit Tracking Dashboard** is a hybrid **C++ and Python** project designed to help you monitor, manage, and predict your progress toward personal goals.

- The **C++ dashboard** provides a console-based interface for tracking habits, setting weekly goals, and managing your daily schedule.
- The **Python scripts** analyze your progress, generate features for machine learning, and predict the likelihood of completing your weekly goals.

This project combines habit tracking, data analysis, and predictive modeling into one system.

##  Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv  

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate  

# Activate (Windows PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate

```

### 2 Install Required Libraries
Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3 Running the C++ Dashboard
```bash
# Navigate to the C++ directory
cd cpp
# Compile the dashboard
make
# Run the dashboard
./dashboard
```

### 4 Running the Python Scripts
```bash
# Visualize Your Progress
# See habit trends and statistics in graph form.
python python/analyze_habits.py

# Generate Daily Features (Run Once)
# This creates or updates your daily_features.csv file.
python python/generate_daily_features.py

# Train the Machine Learning Model
python python/train_model.py

# Predict Today‚Äôs Goal Completion Likelihood
# This uses the trained model to predict if you will complete your weekly goal.
python python/predict.py

```

### Future Ideas
- Add unit tests (ex google tests)
- Add containerization such as Docker
